  // the 'provided' object contains properties and methods that need to be applied to the droppable area.
  // 'snapshot' provides information about the current state of the droppable area, such as whether it is being dragged over or not. Provided by the Droppable component.
  // 'provided.innerRef' is a ref that needs to be attached to the droppable area to make it droppable. Necessary for the Droppable component to function correctly.
  // 'provided.droppableProps' are the props that need to be spread onto the droppable area to make it droppable. Needed by the Droppable component to function correctly.
  // 'provided.placeholder' is a placeholder that needs to be rendered inside the droppable area to maintain the layout during dragging. Needed by the Droppable component to maintain the layout during dragging.
  // the type='task' indicates that this droppable area is for tasks, which is used to differentiate between different types of draggable items in the application.
